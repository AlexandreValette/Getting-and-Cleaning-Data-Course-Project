#Code book for AlexandreValette/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

#Script

The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Finally, the script generates a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type (tidy.txt).

#Variables

    x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test : the data as downloaded.
    train : resulting dataset from the 3 train dataset.
    test : resulting dataset from the 3 test dataset.
    df : resulting dataset from merging train and test.
    featuresWanted : the correct names for the x_data dataset.
    extracts : dataset with the filtered data.
    new_names : vector with formatted column names for extracts.
    extracts.melted : dataset with the melted data from extracts.
    extracts.mean  : dataset with the final result.
