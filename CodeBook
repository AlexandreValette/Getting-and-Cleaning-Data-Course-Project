#Code book for AlexandreValette/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

#Script

The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Finally, the script generates a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type (tidy.txt).

#Variables

    x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test : the data as downloaded.
    train, test : resulting dataset from the merges (see 1.)
    features : the correct names for the x_data dataset,
    A similar approach is taken with activity names through the activities variable.
    all_data merges x_data, y_data and subject_data in a big dataset.
